#Exercise 1 - Use the Digest :: MD5 function to prompt the user for a password twice. 
#If the first doesnâ€™t match the second, have them re-type both.
#Then use Digest :: MD5 to create a hash and store the hash in a file.
#Finally, prompt the user for the password, create a hash of it and 
#then read the file to compare them, Tell the usr if they successfully entered the 
#correct password.
